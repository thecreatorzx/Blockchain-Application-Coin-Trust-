<h1>Coin Trust: Decentralized Transaction Application</h1><br>
Coin Trust is a decentralized transaction application built on blockchain technology. It provides a secure and transparent platform for users to conduct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. With Coin Trust, users can transfer digital assets securely and trustlessly, ensuring the integrity and immutability of their transactions.

Features
Decentralized Transactions: Coin Trust enables users to conduct transactions directly with one another without relying on centralized authorities.

Blockchain Technology: Built on blockchain technology, Coin Trust ensures the security and immutability of transactions through distributed ledger technology.

Transparent and Auditable: All transactions on Coin Trust are transparent and auditable, allowing users to track the flow of assets on the blockchain.

Secure: With cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms, Coin Trust provides a secure environment for users to transact without the risk of fraud or manipulation.

Wallet Integration: Users can manage their digital assets conveniently through wallet integration, providing easy access to funds for transactions.

How It Works
User Registration: Users can register on the Coin Trust platform by creating an account.

Asset Management: Users can manage their digital assets within their wallets, including cryptocurrencies and tokens supported by the Coin Trust platform.

Initiating Transactions: To initiate a transaction, users specify the recipient's email address, the amount to be transferred, and some basic additional transaction details.

Transaction Verification: Transactions are verified and confirmed by the blockchain network through consensus mechanisms, ensuring the validity and integrity of each transaction.

Transaction Settlement: Once verified, transactions are recorded on the blockchain and settled, updating the balance of digital assets in the sender's and recipient's wallets accordingly.

Technology Stack
Blockchain: Coin Trust utilizes a decentralized blockchain network for transaction processing and validation.

Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are employed to automate and enforce transaction rules and agreements on the blockchain.

Cryptographic Algorithms: Cryptographic algorithm SHA-256 is used for secure key generation and transaction validation.

Consensus Mechanisms: Consensus mechanism Proof of Work (PoW) ensure agreement among network participants on the validity of transactions.

Node.js: Node.js is used to create the server.
