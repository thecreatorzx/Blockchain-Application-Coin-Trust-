# BitPay: Decentralized Transaction Application

BitPay is a decentralized transaction application built on blockchain technology. It provides a secure and transparent platform for users to conduct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. With BitPay, users can transfer digital assets securely and trustlessly, ensuring the integrity and immutability of their transactions.

## Features

- Decentralized Transactions: BitPay enables users to conduct transactions directly with one another without relying on centralized authorities.

- Blockchain Technology: Built on blockchain technology, BitPay ensures the security and immutability of transactions through distributed ledger technology.

- Transparent and Auditable: All transactions on BitPay are transparent and auditable, allowing users to track the flow of assets on the blockchain.

- Secure: With cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms, BitPay provides a secure environment for users to transact without the risk of fraud or manipulation.

- Wallet Integration: Users can manage their digital assets conveniently through wallet integration, providing easy access to funds for transactions.

## How It Works

- User Registration: Users can register on the BitPay platform by creating an account.

- Asset Management: Users can manage their digital assets within their wallets, including cryptocurrencies and tokens supported by the BitPay platform.

- Initiating Transactions: To initiate a transaction, users specify the recipient's email address, the amount to be transferred, and some basic additional transaction details.

- Transaction Verification: Transactions are verified and confirmed by the blockchain network through consensus mechanisms, ensuring the validity and integrity of each transaction.

- Transaction Settlement: Once verified, transactions are recorded on the blockchain and settled, updating the balance of digital assets in the sender's and recipient's wallets accordingly.

## Technology Stack

- Blockchain: BitPay utilizes a decentralized blockchain network for transaction processing and validation.

- Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are employed to automate and enforce transaction rules and agreements on the blockchain.

- Cryptographic Algorithms: Cryptographic algorithm SHA-256 is used for secure key generation and transaction validation.

- Consensus Mechanisms: Consensus mechanism Proof of Work (PoW) ensure agreement among network participants on the validity of transactions.

- Node.js: Node.js is used to create the server.
